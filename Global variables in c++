//global variable is usually declared outside the function and can be accessed throughout the program :
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int marks = 80; //global variable

//creating a method
void print()
{
    
    cout << "your marks are : " << marks << endl;
}

int main()
{
    print(); //calling method

    //here we can change the value of globle variable as we can accessed it throughout the code
    marks = 95;
    print(); //calling function again

}
